# I made a project for storing, processing and displaying news.
+ That project include these operations -
```
GET, POST, PUT, DELETE methods for news sources;
GET, POST, PUT, DELETE methods for news;
GET, POST, PUT, DELETE methods for news topics;
GET method for getting list of all news sources;
GET method for getting list of all news topics;
GET method for getting list of all news (with pagination);
GET method for getting list of news by source id (with pagination);
GET method for getting list of news by topic id (with pagination);
```

+ Also -
```
The project contains a security mechanism via the client token API.
The user should receive a token during authentication.

```
+ ### The database used was - MySQL (news_db) -
```
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/news_db
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=

spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL5Dialect
spring.jpa.hibernate.naming.physical-strategy=org.hibernate.boot.model.naming.PhysicalNamingStrategyStandardImpl


server.port=9099
```

## 1.First the user must register
POST - http://localhost:9099/auth/new

+ To register, you need to fill out - 
```
{
    "username": "Nurassyl",
    "email": "nurik@gmail.com",
    "password": "12345678"
}
```

- If successfully registered,  the message comes out - `Sucessfully added`
- If there is already a user with this username, it comes out - `Please create another unique username`


## 2. After registration or if the user already has an account, it must pass a login
POST - http://localhost:9099/auth/authenticate

+ To login - 
```
{
    "username": "Nurassyl",
    "password": "12345678"
}
```
- After a successful login, a token appears that allows us to continue to store, process and display the news. 
- In my case - eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJOdXJhc3N5bCIsImlhdCI6MTY4NDE2MzAzOCwiZXhwIjoxNjg0MTY0ODM4fQ.qekAE7FLzeQDgHid5zQWldOCmAxW5AyC6zUA65Rm_hU
- ### Only using the token we can further do all the above operations

## 3. CRUD operations for `News Sources`
1. `GET` all news sources - http://localhost:9099/news_sources

- By clicking **Authorization > Type > Bearer Token** I pasted token, which I received when I logged in.
- Without this token there will be no access to see all sources of news.

2. `GET` news source by ID - http://localhost:9099/news_sources/2 (instead of 2 we can write any number id)

5. `POST` - http://localhost:9099/news
- To make a post, we first have to write the following code in the Pre-request Script -
```
var current_timestamp = new Date();
postman.setEnvironmentVariable("current_timestamp", current_timestamp.toISOString());
```
- because in the News class we have a Date called `publishedAt` that records the published date of the news.
